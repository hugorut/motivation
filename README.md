The motivate command also takes a second parameter so that you can specify a author. This parameter is an underscored name of the author such as `steve_jobs` or `c_s_lewis`

Motivation gem also allows you to watch files in a directory and print out a quote when something changes. Usefull for getting through those late night coding sessions. You can run:

```sh
motivator --watch [glob,glob]
```
The second parameter after the watch flag is a list of globs of the files you wish to watch, e.g. `./**/*` or `./folder/*`

Then you can have an output similar to this:
